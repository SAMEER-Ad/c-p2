leap year
-The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
-If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
-The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year;
-According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.
